            <h1>Opportunities</h1>
            <p>Autonomous cars present a number of opportunities to us to increase road safety. 
                The levels of driving ability found within autonomous vehicles varies greatly. 
                The current generation of autonomous cars are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SEA) as “Level 2” autonomous vehicles. 
                Future generations of autonomous vehicles are defined, up to level 5, 
                being fully autonomous which requires no human interaction. (Taxonomy and Definitions…, 2021)
            </p>
            <p>
                Level 2 autonomous cars already present us with a number of useful features. 
                Tesla cars, for example, provide a number of useful features, such as: Cruise control which matches the speed of other cars, 
                automatic lane changing, automatic steering, and stopping and starting at lights and signage in traffic. 
                All of these features allow for a simpler and more leisurely driving experience for the user. 
                Another such example provided by the current generation of Teslas is automatic parking, 
                which is when while the driver and car are in a parking building, the driver can exit the car, and the car will find itself a car park. 
                The car can then return to wherever the driver got out from when requested. (Autopilot, n.d.). 
                This allows people to save time and effort when visiting places. 
                The popularity of these features (Carlier, 2022),
                despite being largely insignificant compared to what could be possible with more advanced autonomous vehicles, 
                sets a good precedent for the future of autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In regards to Level 5 (Fully autonomous) vehicles, one of the major examples is, provided the technology can be executed well: 
                a major reduction in, or even elimination of road fatalities. 
                Due to autonomous vehicles not requiring any human interaction, they have the potential to eliminate any driver-caused accident, 
                such as crashes due to tiredness, carelessness, poor driving ability, or other driver error. 
                They could potentially even respond to unexpected circumstances on the road much faster and more sensibly than any human could. 
                For example, Tesla’s director of autopilot software, Ashok Elluswamy, 
                claimed that Tesla’s autopilot prevented 40 crashes per day where the driver mistakenly accelerates instead of braking (Koetsier, 2022). 
            </p>
            <p>
                This concept of not requiring any human interaction extends into other ideas too. 
                For example, level 5 autonomous cars could provide a safe alternative to taxis. 
                Having no driver in a taxi would reduce overhead, and therefore provide a cheaper means of personal transport. 
                This could possibly take people off the road who may have chosen to drive when it would be unsafe, such as if they were inebriated or tired. 
                Other opportunities could present themselves in more specific circumstances, such as allowing seniors to access reliable transport, 
                as they may have trouble getting to public transport stops (Shwartz, 2021). Other examples exist too, 
                such as allowing business workers to do work while travelling, or even just letting people relax while they’re travelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way fully autonomous (Level 5) cars can present us opportunities to increase our road safety is by allowing computers 
                to take over operations such as traffic lights, or merging. On the road, these can be a source of trouble for drivers as for some they can be overwhelming situations, 
                and for others, they may be a source of annoyance or rage when they’re getting held up by traffic. 
                Autonomous cars could, in theory, communicate together via a central or decentralised network, 
                allowing them to manage traffic far more effectively than any system which involves humans. 
                For example, they could calculate traffic light timings, or even eliminate the need for traffic lights altogether by using AI to calculate the fastest way to get everyone through a junction. 
                Another situation they could be useful is in motorways, where they could perfectly merge into traffic, preventing traffic jams and accidents.
