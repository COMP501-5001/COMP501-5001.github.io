            <h1>Our topic: The safety concerns of self-driving cars</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Why did we choose this topic?</h3>
            <p>
                The advancement of AI accelerated the deployment of autonomous cars.
                However, numerous issues arose when adopting this technology into our life.
                One of the most concerning issues is the safety of autonomous cars. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Statistically, car accidents are the most common cause of death.
                The major cause of car accidents is the omission of human's discernment while driving.
                In order to reduce these issues, many IT companies have now commenced developing autonomous cars that can drive safer than humans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the fact that big tech companies are investing in developing autonomous cars, the fatalities from autonomous cars still occurred and killed pedestrians.
                It is mainly caused by the failure to sense the objects by it's machine learning program or the poor system deployment coded by humans.
                Hence, we know it is not easy to deploy autonomous cars that are perfectly safe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe autonomous cars require careful consideration of traffic controls to improve safety concerns.
                If autonomous cars succeed in safe operations, the impact on society will be immeasurable.
                We believe it will improve everyone's lifestyle and avoid the fatality of car accidents.
                Therefore, our team will investigate this problem and propose how our society should adopt autonomous cars safely. 
            </p>

            <h3>How are we managing our work as a group?</h3>
            <p>
                We chose to use a Github repository for our website as it is a good way of collaborating with each other and ensuring that everyone can see the same version of the website.
                It also provides hosting for the website, for easy testing/viewing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Github also provides a discussion board which could potentially be useful in discussing things about the website.
